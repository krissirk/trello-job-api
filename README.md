# trello-job-api
This is an API that exposes a subset of data from a private Trello board tracking my 2017/2018 job search activity. This "experience" API features resources that summarize data from Trello's API in a highly condensed and streamlined fashion. The design of the API and presentation of the summarized Trello data is meant to minimize the work required by a client to render the information.

## Resource(s):
* companies -
* cards -
* applications -
* interviews -
* closed-cards -
